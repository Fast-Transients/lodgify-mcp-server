# Development Milestones

These are proposed milestones for future development of the Lodgify MCP Server.

- **Continuous Integration**: set up GitHub Actions to run tests and `pip-audit` on every push.
- **Database Integration**: add a persistent database layer for storing property and booking data.
- **Expanded Test Coverage**: write tests for error scenarios and API edge cases.
- **Deployment Docs**: document production deployment and container configuration.

Suggestions and contributions are welcome!
